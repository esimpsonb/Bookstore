
It is assumed that the book that is being added to the database is the most famous by that title (The first one that the API returns) and only the fisrt ISBN is saved

The generator only gives the ISBN, not yet added a full description basesd only on the title

The books.csv file is generated from 0 each time, an upgraded version of the ISBN generator should open books.csv as a dataframe and edit it.
